This is my song
And no one can take it away
It's been so long, but now you're here
Here to stay
And I wonder if you know what it means
To find your dreams come true

[Verse 2]
This is my song
And no one can make it a lie
It's been so long since someone
Could make me cry
And I wonder if you know what it means
To laugh as tears go by
